Senior Machine Learning Engineer specialising in developing sophisticated machine learning systems and deploying them at scale. At Knauf Energy Solutions, I design and develop novel machine learning approaches while architecting production ML infrastructure on AWS, including microservices-based deployment pipelines and cloud-native MLOps systems.

My technical toolkit spans the full machine learning engineering spectrum: Python (Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn), deep learning frameworks (PyTorch, JAX, TensorFlow), R (Tidyverse), big data technologies (Hadoop & Spark), SQL, Git for version control, Docker for containerisation, Terraform for Infrastructure as Code (IaC), Linux operating systems, and AWS cloud technologies (SageMaker, Glue, Athena, Step Functions, Lambda, Batch) for robust ML operations and deployment.

My academic foundation includes an MSc in Statistics (Distinction) and BSc in Physics (First-Class Honours) from Imperial College London, where I specialised in advanced ML methodologies and completed deep learning research projects. This blend of theoretical understanding and practical implementation enables me to tackle complex data challenges with innovative approaches.

Passionate about building ML systems that scale efficiently and create meaningful impact.
