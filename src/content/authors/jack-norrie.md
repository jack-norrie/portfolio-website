Senior Machine Learning Engineer specializing in developing sophisticated machine learning systems and deploying them at scale. At Knauf Energy Solutions, I design and develop novel machine learning approaches while leveraging AWS cloud infrastructure to build production-ready systems that drive business outcomes.

My technical toolkit spans the full machine learning engineering spectrum: Python (Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn), deep learning frameworks (PyTorch, TensorFlow, JAX), R (Tidyverse), big data technologies (Hadoop & Spark), SQL, Git for version control, Docker for containerization, Linux operating systems, and cloud technologies for robust ML operations and deployment.

Academic foundation includes an MSc in Statistics (Distinction) and BSc in Physics (First-Class Honours) from Imperial College London, where I specialized in advanced ML methodologies and completed deep learning research projects. This blend of theoretical understanding and practical implementation enables me to tackle complex data challenges with innovative approaches.

Passionate about building ML systems that scale efficiently and create meaningful impact.
