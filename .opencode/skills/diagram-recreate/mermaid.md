## Mermaid rendering

- Convert the spec into Mermaid flowchart or sequence syntax
- Prefer simple shapes and short labels
- Apply Catppuccin Latte palette for fills/strokes
- Iteratively compare layout to the source diagram and adjust spacing/structure to match
- Render using Mermaid CLI or editor export
- Save exported PNGs in `/artifacts` (gitignored artifacts folder)
- Verify the exported PNG is 1920x1080 with white background
